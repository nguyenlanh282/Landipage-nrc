- Address specific concerns (air quality in cities, water safety)
**CTA**: Create urgency without pressure
- "Bảo vệ gia đình ngay hôm nay" (Protect your family today)
- Limited-time offers work well

### Key Psychological Triggers

### Vietnamese-Specific Content Elements

## 4. COLOR PSYCHOLOGY FOR ECO-PRODUCTS

### Green Palette Strategy
**Primary greens** (choose based on positioning):
- **Forest green (#228B22)**: Premium, established, trustworthy
- **Sage green (#9CAF88)**: Gentle, safe, family-friendly
- **Emerald (#50C878)**: Modern, vibrant, innovative
- **Olive (#6B8E23)**: Natural, organic, authentic

**Avoid**: Neon green (cheap), yellow-green (unnatural)

### Supporting Color Palette
**Earth tones** (60% of palette):
- Warm beige/cream (#F5F5DC) - backgrounds
- Soft brown (#D2B48C) - text, borders
- White space (critical for clean aesthetic)

**Accent colors** (10%):
- Warm orange (#FF8C42) - CTAs, urgency elements
- Deep blue (#1B4D89) - trust signals, links

**Text hierarchy**:
- Charcoal gray (#36454F) - body text (better than pure black)
- Dark green (#2C5F2D) - headings

### Vietnamese Market Considerations
- **Red**: Use carefully (associated with luck but also warnings)
- **Gold/yellow**: Premium positioning, prosperity
- **White**: Purity, cleanliness (good for eco-products)
- Avoid excessive black (can be perceived as unlucky)

### Application Guidelines
- 60% neutral (white/cream), 30% green tones, 10% accents
- Green in hero section, product highlights, trust badges
- Earth tones for backgrounds, textures
- High contrast CTA (orange/coral against green)
- Consistent color coding (green = eco benefit, blue = trust)
